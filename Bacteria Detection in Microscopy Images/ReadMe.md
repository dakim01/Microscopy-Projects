# 🦠 Bacteria Detection in Microscopy Images

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end image processing pipeline for detecting bacteria in microscopy images. The system processes raw microscope images, enhances them, segments bacterial regions, and extracts relevant features for analysis.

The goal is to automate bacterial detection using classical image processing techniques.
